This README is provided for my future self as it is the first time I do the advent of code and learning Rust with it at the same time !

---

After some researches, in the end using Cargo is better.

Create a new project
```bash
cargo new <project_name>
```

Check the project is supposed to be able to compile. Lot of time winning instead of compiling each time.
```bash
cargo check
```

Compile. Creates a binary in target/ directory
```bash
cargo build
```

Run (and compile beforehand)
```bash
cargo run
```
