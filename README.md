This README is provided for my future self as it is the first time I do the advent of code and learning Rust with it at the same time !

Compilation:
```rs
rustc main.rs
```

Compilation provides by default a binary with the same name as the given file (so `main`)
Then run it as a classic binary.
```bash
./main
```
